Hello World! I'm Glenn. I'm a self taught programmer aspiring to be a Site Reliability Engineer currently in high school. I have a passion for learning new and innovative technologies alongside with learning how to manage and develop on production grade distributed systems. Currently as of now I've been learning about Go, the RHEL ecoystem, web, and other DevOps tools such as Kubernetes. Alongside that I'm also a proud member of First Tech Challenge team Modibots (3922) and have participated in The Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers at Columbia University. If you have any interesting inquiries about anything tech feel free to contact me at my email displayed on my home page.
